My background is in classical music, but in the last years I have gotten more and more interested in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
At the moment I am finishing my Master thesis at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence.
Right before that I got my Master's degree in piano from the University of Music Stuttgart.
