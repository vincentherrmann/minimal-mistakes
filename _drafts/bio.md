My background is in classical music, but in the last years I have gotten more and more interested in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
At the moment I am finishing my Master thesis at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence.
Right before that I got my Master's degree in piano from the University of Music Stuttgart.

My first active musical experiences came from the Hymnus boy's choir - soon I also started playing the piano.
For that my most important teachers were Monika Giurgiuman, Prof. Kirill Gerstein and Prof. Michael Hauber.
